## Minimize scrap


</div>

### Description

Hi everybody!!

This is my first submission, I made it some time ago in order to save

some money. The application's target is to minimize the scrap in a

wood wall recovering. I had to buy wood strips to recover a wall in a

45 degrees design, so I had to set the optimal lenght to reduce the

scrap. It was very hard to find the matematical model ( combinations, etc)

so I used hard force, to choice random groups and to find the minimal.

Code is very rough but basically works.

It is a very good example using listBoxes

I don't need you vote for me, but comments and feed back will be

appreciated.
